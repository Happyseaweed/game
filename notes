SAVE / LOAD SYSTEM

1. Main Idea
    a) Save and load from file using C++ (Header: fstream)
    b) IT IS HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL :D
2. How do we accomplish?
    a) Make a file for save data
        i. ifstream and ofstream
    b) Make a function to process save data
        i. Possible function layout:
            - [for loop] going through .dat file
            - depending [if/else] on word number (variable used in the for loop), 
            update corresponding variable
            - continue until .dat file is completed
    c) Give options to players to save and load
    d) Give steps to get to the point in time the program is in (simple, but ineffcient)
    e) By condensing (keeping filesize low) most important (unique) info in a file (.dat) 
    and reading (loading) the info
        i. Important (unique to each instance of the program) Data
            - # of probs
            - Scanners percents: atmosphere, gravity, resources, water, temperature
            - Databases: Scientifitic and Cultural
            - Current event
